## MATH3303 tools
These are various tools I used to help in any sort of answer checking, etc in MATH3303 - Coding and cryptography, and to check my knowledge. They are also my solutions to challenges from lectures (not assignment problems). They may be incorrect(or, in fact, incomplete) at times. Feel free to use them or make suggestions at your discretion.
